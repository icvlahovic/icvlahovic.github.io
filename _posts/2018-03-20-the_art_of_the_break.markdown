I have this funny feeling that at least a handful of the hardcore programmer types among my readers saw my title just now and are instinctively expecting a brief yet comprehensive treatise on loops and how to properly utilize break statements for early exit.  

Those folks are probably the ones who need to read this post the most, because I hate to disappoint you, but I was actually referring to the other kind of break.  No, not the harmonic meeting point on clarinet between the low “chalumeau” register and the middle “clarion” register, notorious for tripping up beginning clarinetists (although as a music teacher, I could write a whole other article on that!)  You know…respites!  Downtime!  Taking a breather!  That thing you might be taking right now, even though you’re eating lunch at your desk again—drinking, really, because lunch is a protein shake or a bottle of Soylent, just like yesterday…and the day before that—because you just have so. much. work. to get done before that deadline and you’re losing your mind and you’re burnt out af andlifeismovingamillionmilesanhourand—

Chill.  Relax.  You got this.  Take a deep breath.  Good!

I’ve been hyping up a brilliant book that I read recently to literally anyone that will listen: Daniel H. Pink’s most recent release, [*When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing*](https://www.amazon.com/When-Scientific-Secrets-Perfect-Timing/dp/0735210624).  The premise is simple: we have thousands upon thousands of “how-to” books that purport to offer the complete novice the best way to do something, whether it’s learning a new language, learning to crochet, or learning to…[sharpen...pencils](https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/how-to-sharpen-pencils/)…?  But what if, Pink posits, our successes and failures aren’t always determined by *how* we do something, but by *when* we do it?  In what could be the world’s first “when-to” book, Pink delves into the way we interact with and are affected by time, referencing dozens of scientific studies and touching on a variety of topics ranging from chronotypes to group synchronization to America’s entry into World War I (no, seriously).  The chapter that struck me as most immediately applicable to my life, however, is titled “Afternoons and Coffee Spoons: The Power of Breaks, the Promise of Lunch, and the Case for a Modern Siesta.”  For the sake of length, I won’t go into quite the same level of detail as Mr. Pink, but I’d at least like to share a few of his tips and tricks that I’ve begun to implement into my routine during my nascent journey into the world of programming; perhaps you’ll find them helpful, as well!

There’s nothing more dangerous and frenetic and weirdly beautiful than a programmer in the throes of a coding binge.  Laser focused, fingers blazing, cranking out lines of code as if their lives—or at least their jobs—depended on it, programmers typically display a truly admirable work ethic.  

![Huh?  Eh.](https://media.giphy.com/media/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/giphy.gif)

But even the best programmers hit walls and mental blocks, and these are the opportune moments to step away briefly and take a break.  Pink offers us “five guiding principles” as to how we might go about doing so:

**1. “Something beats nothing”** – Habituation is a physiological decrease in response to stimulus after prolonged and repeated exposure to that stimulus.  Simply put, we begin to lose focus if we work on the same thing for too long.  Frequent short breaks can interrupt that monotony and restore focus, and they can take many forms depending on your own personal circumstances, from taking a five-minute walk every hour, to doing a quick deep breathing exercise, to the “20-20-20 method”: every 20 minutes, stop working, stand up, and look at an object 20 feet away from you for 20 seconds.

Similarly, Barbara Oakley, a professor at Oakland University and host of the Coursera class [“Learning How to Learn”](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) (which I also highly recommend), suggests software developer (!!!) Francesco Cirillo’s ["Pomodoro Technique"](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique)—so named for the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that he utilized when studying—in which one sets a timer (I use my phone) to 25 minutes and works until it dings, then takes a 3-5 minute break, and repeats.  You can increase or decrease a pomodoro’s length according to your own preferences, and your breaks should increase in duration as you progress through subsequent pomodoros (pomodori?), but by setting goals in terms of punctuated periods of time rather than in terms of task completion, you can quickly and easily improve your work flow and increase your motivation.

**2.  “Moving beats stationary”** – Those five-minute walks I just mentioned are what researchers call “microbursts of activity,” and they’ve been shown to “[improve] mood throughout the day and [reduce] feelings of fatigue in the late afternoon,” as well as “increase motivation and concentration and enhance creativity.”  Take a walk to the bathroom, even if you don’t have to go.  If you’re heading outside, take the stairs instead of the elevator.  Do some chair yoga at your desk.  Perhaps you use already use a standing desk.  Pink even suggests downsizing your personal water bottle as to increase how frequently you need to refill it.  [Sitting is the new smoking](https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/), so every little bit counts! 

**3.  “Social beats solo”** – As an ambivert—an extrovert with introverted tendencies and limited battery life for socializing—I understand the value of quality alone time on a deeply personal level.  At my previous job, I used to sit scrolling through my e-mails and Facebook News Feed while I ate my lunch alone in a corner where no one would bother me, which sounds much more depressing now that I’m typing it out.  

![Ahhh, sweet solitude....](https://media.giphy.com/media/vvUdoYisXiLO8/giphy.gif)

However, research out of South Korea shows that “social breaks—talking with coworkers about something other than work—are more effective at reducing stress and improving mood than either cognitive breaks (answering e-mail) or nutrition breaks (getting a snack)…particularly when we’re free to choose with whom we spend the time.”  Grab a cup of tea or coffee with a peer or coworker.  Arrange to eat your lunch with someone you don’t normally get to talk to.  If you’re a smoker—no judgment from me—find a buddy and take your smoke breaks together.  Embrace your inner social butterfly!  

**4.  "Outside beats inside"** – Weather permitting, of course...I wouldn’t necessarily recommend taking a stroll outside in Syracuse in the winter!  But if it’s a nice day and your work near a park or on a larger campus and the opportunity arises, “people who take short walks outdoors return with better moods and greater replenishment than people who walk indoors.”  If you can’t get away from your desk for that long, hang out near the ficus in the break room or buy a bonsai tree for your desk and at least pretend you’re outside.

**5.  "Fully detached beats semi-detached"** – If you’re taking a break from work, but you’re still returning all those texts you forgot to reply to and checking how many Facebook likes you got on your new profile picture, are you really taking a break?  The same South Korean study from earlier says you’re not.  Attempting to combine our breaks with other “cognitively demanding [activities]” defeats the purpose of taking a break in the first place, while the study showed that “relaxation breaks (stretching or daydreaming) eased stress and boosted mood in a way that multitasking breaks did not.”  Moreover, “tech-free breaks… ‘increase vigor and reduce emotional exhaustion.’ ”  Don’t be afraid to check out and tune out the world for a moment.  Don’t be afraid to walk away from your work or (*gasp*) your extraprofessional social life for 5-10 minutes at a time.  I guarantee it’ll all still be there when you get back. 

Again, what I love about all these guidelines and strategies is how incredibly easy they are to implement into a daily routine, and how great the return on investment is for relatively minimal effort.  Unless you live in Spain, you likely won’t have the chance to leave work and go home for lunch, and unless you work remotely, you probably won’t be able to take a nap during the workday.  But what you’ll almost definitely have is a handful of opportunities to get away from your desk—or at the very least stand up and look away from your monitor—on a fairly regular basis.  Use them to your advantage and embrace the break!  The work we do as programmers is mentally grueling, often solitary, and yes, physically taxing in its own way.  We shouldn’t let our biological need for rest and variety fall by the wayside in favor of our dedication to that work.
